# Muffin or Chihuahua ?

Muffin vs. Chihuahua Image Classification with PyTorch
Project Overview

This project involves building an image classification model using PyTorch to distinguish between images of muffins and chihuahuas. The challenge emerges from the visual similarities between the two classes, making it an interesting and funny problem for image classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle: [Muffin vs. Chihuahua Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/muffin-vs-chihuahua-image-classification/data). It consists of images categorized into two classes:

    Muffins
    Chihuahuas
